# Final Assignment

Anxiety Distress is a chat service for the DT community to express their frustrations and seek comfort or assistance in their work.  A “distress” ball is also connected to the chat if you are unable to express your feelings verbally.

This project entails the backend and frontend communicating through socket.io.  The code is executed on a rasberrypi and arduino with a pressure sensitive touch sensor.  The user can access the chat on the web by typing in their message or use the stress ball to automatically send a message into the chat space.  The stress ball messages are different depending on the amount of pressure the user expresses.

Tools used:
    - RaspberryPi
    - Arduino
    - IEFSR pressure sensitive touch sensor
    - Backend: Node (socket.io, serialport)
    - Frontend
    - MongoDB (implemented, yet currently not working)
